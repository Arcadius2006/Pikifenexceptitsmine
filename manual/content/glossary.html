    <p>A glossary of terms used in <i>Pikifen</i>, both for casual play, and for making content. This glossary will not include terms popular in the <i>Pikmin</i> franchise, since you can find more about those on <a href="https://www.pikminwiki.com">Pikipedia</a>, and will also not focus on terms used in the engine's code, even though most of them match what you'd read outside of the code.</p>

    <dl id="absolute-angle">
      <dt>Absolute angle</dt>
      <dd>Unlike a <a href="#R">relative angle</a>, this refers to the <a href="#angle">angle</a> facing a cardinal direction in the area. 0 points to the right/east, 10 means 10 degrees clockwise of east, etc.</dd>
    </dl>

    </dl>
    <dl id="action">
      <dt>Action</dt>
      <dd>Something that an object can do in its <a href="#S">script</a>. This includes walking to a certain point, losing <a href="#H">health</a>, changing its <a href="#A">animation</a>, etc.</dd>
      <dd>Further reading: <a href="script.html">Object script</a>.</dd>
      <dd>See also: <a href="#P">Player action</a>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl id="active">
      <dt>Active</dt>
      <dd>If an object is active that means it will be processed on the current frame. To save on performance, objects that are off-camera and too far from any Pikmin or leader (and also not marked as always-active) will become inactive, meaning they are essentially frozen in time. In reality they don't process their logic each frame, and/or don't check for interactions with other objects, but they still receive events, can spawn and despawn, etc.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl id="animation">
      <dt>Animation</dt>
      <dd>A series of <a href="#F">frames</a> that change the way an object looks. When put together nicely, these make it look like the object is walking, growling, chomping, etc. Animations are independent of what the object is actually doing. For instance, it can be walking, but it could be frozen in appearance, which would make it appear to slide. That said, accurate animations are necessary for gameplay reasons, like <a href="#H">hitboxes</a>.</dd>

    </dl>
    <dl id="angle">
      <dt>Angle</dt>
      <dd>A direction. Angles are represented in degrees, meaning they range from 0 to 360. The number increases as the angle goes clockwise.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl id="assert">
      <dt>Assert, Assertion</dt>
      <dd>When something is wrong with the engine, and it is detected by an assertion, the program usually shuts down in a controlled manner. This helps because the developer can know what assert was triggered exactly, to make finding the problem easier.</dd>

      <dd>The name of a file on your machine, e.g. <code>berry.png</code>. It consists of a base name (<code>Berry</code> in this case) and an extension, which is the part with the dot and whatever comes after (<code>.png</code>).

      <dd>Whenever you need to refer to the name of a file in <i>Pikifen</i>, always be sure that the extension is included and that the uppercase and lowercase letters match what the file's name says (since some player's filesystems are case sensitive). e.g. Don't just write <code>Berry</code> or <code>berry.png</code>.</dd>

    <dl id="glow">
      <dt>Glow</dt>
      <dd>A way to brighten up an object. Due to Allegro limitations, it's not a real glow in the current versions of the engine because: 1. the brightness is limited to the bitmap's original pixels &#8211; darker bitmaps have a harder time becoming brighter; 2. the glow doesn't bleed and fade out, but is limited to the exact shape of the original bitmap.</dd>

    <dl id="hazard">
      <dt>Hazard</dt>
      <dd>Like in the canon games, a hazard refers to the concept of danger, not to a physical object. Electricity (danger of being shocked), fire (danger of burning up), etc. are all hazards, but electrical wires, fire geysers, and so on are just obstacles whose attacks involve hazards.</dd>

    <dl id="health">
      <dt>Health</dt>
      <dd>Every <a href="#O">object</a> in the engine has an amount of health, whether that is used for anything or not. Objects can be attacked in a few ways, and doing so depletes health. When the health reaches zero, the object is considered dead, and its behavior when that happens depends on the type of object.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl id="height-effect">
      <dt>Height effect</dt>
      <dd>To help portray depths, objects that are in mid-air may appear larger than they would appear on land. Or if they are falling into a pit, they may appear smaller and smaller. This is called the "height effect".</dd>

      <dd>A hitbox is a part of a <a href="#S">sprite</a> that represents where a <a href="#B">body part</a> is at that moment. It also contains information about how that body part relates to combat at that moment &#8211; the body part could be vulnerable to enemy attacks, it could be causing damage of its own, etc.</dd>

    <dl id="itch">
      <dt>Itch</dt>
      <dd>When an object has been taking damage for a while, an "itch" <a href="#E">event</a> will be triggered. This periodic event allows an enemy to shake Pikmin off when it is under attack. In order for the enemy to not shake several times in a row, an "itch" event will only be triggered if enough time has passed since the last one, and if enough damage has been done since the last one.</dd>

This is assuming the object is facing the right/east. If it isn't, the coordinates rotate around the object, such that a positive X is always in front of the object. So for coordinates "50,100", this would mean 50 units in front of the object, and 100 units to its right-hand side.</dd>
