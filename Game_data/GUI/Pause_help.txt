	gameplay_basics{
		Controlling leaders;You take control of a leader, and your job is to order your Pikmin to do tasks. Organization, planning, and multitasking are essential to make the most out of your time!;Help/Leader.jpg
		Calling idle Pikmin;You can call an idle Pikmin to your group by whistling it or bumping against it. Afterwards, it will start following you.;Help/Whistling.jpg
		Throwing;Throw a Pikmin in your group towards a task or wildlife, in order to have it work on it or start attacking.;Help/Throwing_Pikmin.jpg
		Idle Pikmin habits;Idle Pikmin have a glow to them. When idle, they will also work on nearby things on their own.;Help/Idle_Pikmin.jpg
		Making Pikmin idle;Throwing a Pikmin at an empty spot will leave it idling where it lands. It's also possible to dismiss them all directly.;Help/Idle_Pikmin.jpg
		Onion;Pikmin live in nests called Onions. When under an Onion, you can store Pikmin inside or call them out.;Help/Onion.jpg
		Growing Pikmin;Pikmin can carry things to the Onion. After delivery, the Onion will create new Pikmin!;Help/Carrying.jpg
		Pikmin types;Different Pikmin types have different strengths and weaknesses. Always try to use the right Pikmin for the job!;Help/Pikmin_types.jpg
		Swapping Pikmin types;You will only throw Pikmin of the current standby type. Change the standby type to throw other Pikmin.;Help/Pikmin_types_HUD.jpg
		Carrying target;Some items need multiple Pikmin to carry. The type of Pikmin receiving the object at the Onion matches the majority of carriers.;Help/Carrying_rules.jpg
		Obstacles;Some obstacles will require multiple Pikmin to work together to clear them, sometimes by combining their strengths, sometimes their weights.;Help/Obstacle.jpg
		Leader swapping;You can swap control between leaders. Try leaving different leaders with different groups of Pikmin so you can multitask.;Help/Leaders_HUD.jpg
		Throwing teammates;Other leaders can also join your group, or be thrown like Pikmin. Use this to reach new places.;Help/Throwing_leaders.jpg
		Pikmin deaths;Pikmin can be eaten, burned up, or die in other ways. Their strength lies in their numbers, however!;Help/Combat.jpg
		Enemy combat;Learn how each enemy works, and how best to attack them! Try aiming for their weak spots.;Help/Weak_spots.jpg
		Pikmin counters;Use the counters at the bottom of the HUD to keep an eye on Pikmin counts. These only count Pikmin, though the amount ready at standby can also refer to leaders if you have any selected.;Help/Pikmin_counters.jpg
		Radar;Keep an eye out on your Pikmin and objectives with the radar in the pause menu.;Help/Radar.jpg

	advanced_gameplay{
		Balancing Pikmin amounts;The more Pikmin doing something together, the more efficient and effective they will be. But too many in one place means things like shortcut opening or reinforcement growing aren't getting done. Plan carefully!;Help/Pikmin_balance.jpg
		Saving Pikmin;If your Pikmin are in trouble, whistling them is generally a good catch-all way of saving them!;Help/Saving_Pikmin.jpg
		Maturity;Pikmin with a leaf on their head walk and carry objects slowly. Bud Pikmin are a bit faster, and flower Pikmin are the fastest. To increase a Pikmin's maturity, let it stay underground for a while before plucking, or feed it nectar.;Help/Maturity.jpg
		Sprays;Use sprays to help you out. Spicy sprays speed your Pikmin up, and bitter sprays freeze enemies!;Help/Sprays.jpg
		Carrying path;Pikmin take the shortest path available to their destination. If a barrier is blocking a shorter path, consider taking it down.;Help/Paths.jpg
		Excess suffering;Pikmin that have been recently burned, poisoned, etc. will survive for less time if it happens again! This "health" value eventually returns to normal over time.;Help/Saving_Pikmin.jpg
		Getting up;If a Pikmin got knocked back, is lying on the floor, and about to be attacked, whistle it to make it get up faster.;Help/Getting_up.jpg
		Onion menu;Whether you're ordering Pikmin to go in the Onion or calling some out, try holding down the button on-screen to choose your numbers faster.;Help/Onion_menu.jpg
		Go Here;Using the radar, command a leader to go somewhere and then change to a different leader. While they're busy walking, you're busy working!;Help/Radar.jpg

		Dismiss;Dismiss your group with \k dismiss \k. If you're swarming, they will be dismissed in that direction.;Help/Dismissing.jpg

		Punch;When you have no Pikmin in your group, throw a punch with \k throw \k.;Help/Punching.jpg
		Lie down;Lie down with \k lie_down \k. Nearby Pikmin will pick you up and carry you to an Onion, so use this opportunity to swap to a new leader and do something else.;Help/Lying_down.jpg

		Pellet;Pellets are like food for Pikmin, making them good sources for more Pikmin. The number on them specifies their weight. Try matching the receiving Pikmin type with their color!;Help/Pellet.jpg
		Nectar;Pikmin that drink nectar will go up in maturity. The more mature a Pikmin, the faster it'll move.;Help/Nectar.jpg
		Egg;Eggs usually have nectar inside, but if you're lucky, they can drop some spray drops.;Help/Egg.jpg
		Bomb rock;Bomb rocks can be picked up by any Pikmin. Throw a Pikmin with one to drop it and start its fuse. If a bomb rock Pikmin gets bit by an enemy, it'll snatch the bomb instead!;Help/Bomb_rock.jpg
		Reinforced wall;Reinforced walls cannot be destroyed by Pikmin directly. Try some explosive force instead.;Help/Reinforced_wall.jpg

		Gas pipe;Pipes coming out from the floor that continuously spew gas can prove deadly to most Pikmin. White Pikmin can destroy them, however.;Help/Gas_pipe.jpg
		Crystal;If you see a lump of crystal, or anything that looks glass-like, try throwing Rock Pikmin at it to break it!;Help/Crystal.jpg
		Flukeweed;Flukeweeds look like spiraling plants, and usually hide something underneath their roots. Winged Pikmin can pull these plants out.;Help/Flukeweed.jpg
