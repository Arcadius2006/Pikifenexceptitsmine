Misc. useful info
    1 pixel on the engine, at 1x zoom level, is 0.05cm

                            Diameter  Radius  Height
        Pikmin (real):      0.5cm     0.25cm  1.2cm (head to feet, sans stem)
        Pikmin (engine):    10px      5px     24px  (head to feet, sans stem)
        Olimar (real):      1.6cm     0.8cm   2.3cm (helmet to feet, sans antenna)
        Olimar (engine):    32px      16px    46px  (helmet to feet, sans antenna)
    Pikmin throw times in Pikmin 2
        Red, Blue, White: 1.3
        Yellow: 1.6
        Purple: 1.8


To optimize the canon leaf shadow textures for use in the engine, do the following
    1) Convert it to black and white (Pikmin 2's are a bit blueish, but b+w works best for the engine).
    2) Apply an alpha mask of itself (inverted) onto itself. This makes the light areas transparent, and the dark ones opaque.
    3) Set the brightness to 0% (-100 in Paint.NET), and the contrast to 150% (50 in Paint.NET).
    4) Set the opacity of the whole thing to 75% (192 in Paint.NET).
    Ideally, you want the areas fully shrouded in shade to be close to RGBA 0 0 0 128, and the light areas should be fully transparent (0 alpha). Tweak the brightness on step 3 and the opacity on step 4 until you get these values.


Creating tree leaf shadow textures
    1) Get all of the leaf/branch textures you'll need (no background).
    2) Create a new image and place them at will.
    3) When done, turn the image black and white.
    4) Change the image's levels, and raise the input blacks to almost max (such that you only get a silhouette of the leafs).
    5) Paint the transparents parts between the leafs and edges of the image black (optional, but recommended).
    6) Lower this layer's opacity to 50%, more or less.
    7) Do a Gaussian Blur, such that the edges of the leafs aren't well defined, but they're still understandable as leafs (2 or 3 pixel radius might do the trick).


Notes on creating textures
    Google is your friend.
    GIMP's Heal selection http://registry.gimp.org/node/15118 plugin and Make seamless tool are a great help.


Creating sounds
    Save as an ogg, 8/10 quality, 16000 Hz
    
    Creating whistle sounds
        1) First, if the sound you're using doesn't have a continuous section of at least 3 seconds, you'll have to create it.
            1.1) Grab a continuous section of the sound and place it in a new project.
            1.2) Grab the starting 0.3s (more or less) and apply an Adjustable Fade. Type is Fade Up, Mid-fade adjust is 50, Start and End are 0 and 100.
            1.3) Grab the final 0.3s (more or less) and place them on a new track.
            1.4) Move this new track to the start of the sound.
            1.5) Apply Adjustable Fade on this new track. Same settings as before, except Type is Fade Down.
            1.6) Render both tracks into a single one. Use this as the whistle's loop.
        2) To create a whistle sound:
            2.1) Grab 0.130s of the loop, preferably somewhere along the middle, and place it in a track.
            2.2) Select the first 0.02s (more or less) and give it a fade in.
            2.3) Select the last 0.08s (more or less) and give it a fade out.
            2.4) That creates the first note of the whistle. After this note, add 2.87s worth of the loop sound.
            2.5) Select the first 0.02s (more or less) of this second note and give it a fade in.
            2.6) Add the "sine wave wobble effect" sound to another track.
            2.7) Crop to 3 seconds.
        3) To create a dismiss sound:
            3.1) Grab 0.8s of the loop, preferably somewhere along the middle, and place it in a track.
            3.2) Select the first 0.02s (more or less) and give it a fade in.
            3.3) Select the last 0.06s (more or less) and give it a fade out.
            3.4) That creates the first note of the dismiss sound. Copy and paste after to create the second note.
            3.5) To create the third note, do the same as for the first note, but its total duration is 0.32s, and the fade out lasts 0.08s.
            3.6) Add the "sine wave wobble effect" sound to another track.
            3.7) Speed up this new track by 1.5x, so it sounds faster and higher-pitched.
            3.8) Select the 0.8s after 0.48s of the wobble track and fade out.
            3.9) Crop to 0.56 seconds.
            3.10) Add the "dismiss drums" sound to another track.
    
    Creating Pikmin noises
        1) Grab the original noise, and slow it down to 0.5x speed.
        2) Record an imitation of the noise. Trying to match the voice's timbre and hitting the highest notes the voice hits is important.
        3) Speed up the imitation to 2.0x speed.
        Tips:
            Looks like being loud helps.
            You'll want to make your noise (sans speed up) in the tone of C4.


To add a glow to the cursor on GIMP
    Alpha to selection.
    Grow selection by 2.
    Selection blur by 5.
    Bucket fill the selection in a different layer.
    Set that layer's opacity to 75%.


Checklist for making a new enemy:
    Script
        Common events for most states.
            Death.
            Bottomless pit.
            "Big damage".
            Touched hazard.
    Sprite sheet
        Add a "palette" of the gradients used to the left of the image.
    Animations
        The attack animations must hit close to the enemy as well.
        Make sure the idle animation is not consisted of solely one boring frame.
        Check if all instances of the standard "body" hitbox are latchable (if they're meant to).
        Check if all instances of the standard "attack" hitbox are disabled, except when they're needed.
        Check if all hitboxes have the correct Z and height.
