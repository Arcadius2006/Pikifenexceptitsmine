Misc. useful info
    1 pixel on the engine, at 1x zoom level, is 0.05cm
    Dimensions:
                            Diameter  Radius  Height
        Pikmin (real):      0.5cm     0.25cm  1.2cm (head to feet, sans stem)
        Pikmin (engine):    10px      5px     24px  (head to feet, sans stem)
        Olimar (real):      1.6cm     0.8cm   2.3cm (helmet to feet, sans antenna)
        Olimar (engine):    32px      16px    46px  (helmet to feet, sans antenna)
    Pikmin throw times in Pikmin 2
        Red, Blue, White: 1.3
        Yellow: 1.6
        Purple: 1.8


To optimize the canon leaf shadow textures for use in the engine, do the following
    1) Convert it to black and white (Pikmin 2's are a bit blueish, but b+w works best for the engine).
    2) Apply an alpha mask of itself (inverted) onto itself. This makes the light areas transparent, and the dark ones opaque.
    3) Set the brightness to 0% (-100 in Paint.NET), and the contrast to 150% (50 in Paint.NET).
    4) Set the opacity of the whole thing to 75% (192 in Paint.NET).
    Ideally, you want the areas fully shrouded in shade to be close to RGBA 0 0 0 128, and the light areas should be fully transparent (0 alpha). Tweak the brightness on step 3 and the opacity on step 4 until you get these values.


To add a glow to the cursor on GIMP
    Alpha to selection
    Grow selection by 2
    Selection blur by 5
    Bucket fill the selection in a different layer
    Set that layer's opacity to 75%


Checklist for making a new enemy:
    Script
        Common events for most states
            Death
            Bottomless pit
            "Big damage"
            Touched hazard
    Sprite sheet
        Add a "palette" of the gradients used to the left of the image
    Animations
        The attack animations must hit close to the enemy as well
        Make sure the idle animation is not consisted of solely one boring frame
        Check if all instances of the standard "body" hitbox are latchable (if they're meant to)
        Check if all instances of the standard "attack" hitbox are disabled, except when they're needed
        Check if all hitboxes have the correct Z and height
