    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    
    <p>You can make Pikmin types, leaders, areas, and so much more, so they can then be used in-game. The ways to make content vary, but are in general made to be easy and intuitive. Content like types of objects, sprays, and so on can be freely made, but new game mechanics and logic cannot. This also includes enemies, areas, etc. that make use of any new mechanic.</p>
    <p>Content, as well as most customizable things in the engine, are just standard graphics, audio, or text files &ndash; you can use your favorite programs to edit them or create new ones. Knowledge about how files and folders work in your operative system is recommended, almost a requirement. That said, some content is a bit too complex for you to edit by hand with a standard program, so instead you will want to use one of the editors inside the engine, which are specialized for the job.</p>
    <p>A good starting point is to check out the pre-packaged content that can be found in the <code>Game_data</code> folder included with the engine. From there, you can add your own spin to the content that is already there by changing the files. Or you can make new content blindly by yourself. Or copy-paste the content that already exists to serve as a basis for new things. Or check the <a href="quick_start.html">quick start guide</a> to get some pointers so you can figure out the rest for yourself. Or read any of the in-depth tutorials <a href="#tutorials">here</a> to have a more guided experience. Or enter one of the aforementioned editors and feel your way around.</p>
    <p>As long as the right content is in the right folder, and/or has the name that the other content or engine expects it to, you can just work on it, save, and at any moment start the engine and test it right away. As you make content, keep in mind that most user-made mistakes will be caught by the engine and reported in the file <code>/User_data/Error_log.txt</code>. You should make a point to fix these problems as soon as possible, otherwise the engine might behave erratically or even crash.</p>

    <h2 id="data-file">Data file</h2>

    <p>Data files usually contain information about how some content or engine feature works. They are actually just everyday text files, with the <code>.txt</code> <a href="glossary.html#E">extension</a>, though with a specific format. The engine reads a data file one line at a time. The most basic type of line is a simple property and its value. The property's name comes first, followed by an equals sign, and then the value. Data files may also contain blocks, which in turn can contain properties or blocks. A block starts with its name, followed by an opening curly brace, and ends on a line that contains solely the closing brace.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    
<pre>property = value 1
block {
    property_inside_block = value_2
    sub_block {
        property_inside_sub_block = another value
    }
}</pre>
    
    <p>It is good practice to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style">indent</a> the lines inside a block. The deeper the block, the deeper the indentation. The engine ignores any spaces or tabs before the first word in the line, so add as many as you want. The engine will also not read empty lines. As a final note, the engine will not read lines that have two slashes before the first word. Meaning that something like <code>//This is a comment.</code> will not be read. You can use these comments to explain or label parts of the file to make it easier to understand.</p>
    
    <p><b>Warning</b>: avoid Window's "Notepad" program to edit these data files, since they usually show up broken or all in a single line. Try something like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a> instead.</p>

    <h2 id="sharing">Sharing with others</h2>

    <p>You may want to share custom content you've made with others across the web. You could just toss them the files you made or edited, and let them sort it out, but not everyone has the technical context you have to know what does what, what depends on which content, and which files go where. Plus having to work it out will discourage people from trying out your stuff. So here's a nice procedure you can follow to make everyone's life easier:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Start by creating a folder somewhere, like on your desktop, with the name of your content.</li>
      <li>Inside, create a <code>Game_data</code> folder. All of the content you're sharing will go here.</li>
      <li>
        Every component that your custom content has will need to be copied here. This goes for graphics, areas, objects, particle generators, etc. The folders you create here should have the same names and organization as your <i>Pikifen</i> installation's <code>Game_data</code> folder. So for instance, <code>My mod/Game_data/Graphics/Textures</code> would have any custom textures you have created or edited that are required for your content.
        <ul>
          <li>Does your creation have custom graphics? If so, create the folder <code>My mod/Game_data/Graphics</code> and put them inside.</li>
          <li>Does your creation have custom textures? If so, create the folder <code>My mod/Game_data/Graphics/Textures</code> and put them inside.</li>
          <li>Does your creation have custom areas? If so, create the folder <code>My mod/Game_data/Areas</code> and put them inside.</li>
          <li>Does your creation have custom objects? If so, create the folder <code>My mod/Game_data/Types/&lt;object category&gt;/&lt;object type&gt;</code> and put them inside.</li>
          <li>Does your creation have custom particle generators? If so, create the folder <code>My mod/Game_data/Particle_generators</code> and put them inside.</li>
          <li>And so on, and so forth, for stuff like hazards, liquids, status effects, and anything else you've made for your custom content.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Right-click your content's <code>Game_data</code> folder and zip it. The exact option you should click depends on your operative system and programs, but you're looking for an option to create a compressed archive file, otherwise known as a zip file.</li>
      <li>Share it around!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>With this sort of zip file, any player that wants to try your content out simply needs to download your zip file, extract its <code>Game_data</code> folder into their <i>Pikifen</i> installation folder, and all of your custom content will be dumped into their own <code>Game_data</code> folder, with every file already in the correct spot.</p>

    <p>More complex or unique creations may require different procedures. Feel free to do what you feel is best, but try to make life simple for the person installing it on the other end!</p>

    <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>If you've made changes to a data file, you don't need to close the engine to test your changes (with a few exceptions). Simply reload the current area.</li>
      <li>Avoid using highly-saturated or bright colors in general. Those colors work better to call attention to the player, like a Pikmin's idle glow, or some HUD element. If everything is bright, not only does it make it so no element can call the player's attention, but also gives the game a sort of "plastic" look.</li>
      <li>When making Pikmin types, avoid making them solid green or black. Green Pikmin blend too much with grass, a floor texture encountered in a lot of places, and black Pikmin are too hard to see in darker places. If you want, you can add some details so at least some part of the Pikmin can be seen clearly.</li>
      <li>When creating some content that will only be used as a gimmick in a specific area, try naming it after the area's name. e.g. "Backyard Garden sprinkler". This way, your name doesn't clash with other content that has a similar name but is used in some other area. Plus, if someone checks the list of objects, textures, etc., they can right away understand what that specific niche thing is used for.</li>
    </ul>
