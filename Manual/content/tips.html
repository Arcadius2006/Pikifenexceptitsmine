    <h1>Tips</h1>
    
    <p>Here are some tips for the engine!</p>
    
    <h2 id="general">General gameplay mechanics</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>To drop a held Pikmin without throwing it, keep the throw button held, and press the whistle button.</li>
      <li>If you dismiss while swarming in a certain direction, the group will be dismissed in that direction.</li>
      <li>Your Pikmin actually have health. Though it slowly goes back up on its own, Pikmin that have been recently burned, poisoned, etc. will survive for less time if it happens again!</li>
      <li>If a Pikmin got knocked back, is lying on the floor, and about to be attacked, whistle it to make it get up faster.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="pre-packaged">Pre-packaged content</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>You can safely leave a Pikmin armed with a bomb rock on the path of a hungry enemy. The enemy will instead swallow the bomb rock and leave the Pikmin unharmed. Just make sure to call the Pikmin out of the blast radius.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="making">Making content</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>If you're having trouble understanding why your custom mob is acting the way it is, try enabling the <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tools</a>, aiming your cursor at it and using the "mob info" maker tool (5 key, by default).</li>
      <li>See <a href="area_tips.html">area tips</a> for tips on how to make good areas.</li>
      <li>If you've made changes to a <a href="data_file.html">data file</a>, you don't need to close the engine to test your changes (with a few exceptions). Simply reload the current area.</li>
    </ul>
