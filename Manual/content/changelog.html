    <p>The following is a general changelog for <i>Pikifen</i>. This changelog will only list the most notable differences between each version of the engine; for a more detailed list of changes throughout the development period, check the <a href="https://github.com/Espyo/Pikifen/commits/master">commit log on GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>Some versions may be unable to read content created in older versions. If you want to keep your content from one version to the next, read the "Content making changes" list in that update's section.</p>

    <p>Versions are numbered after the format <code>major.minor.revision</code>. The major number increases when the project is radically different from the major version before it. The minor number increases every time there are a bunch of changes. The revision number increases when there are bug fixes on the revision before it, and does not break compatibility.</p>

      <li>
        Missions:
        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> Mission-type areas. Gameplay during missions usually involves reaching a goal, avoiding some fail conditions, and getting medals based on several scoring criteria.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> The ability to play when there are no available leaders, or even if there were none to begin with. There isn't much to do in this state other than move the camera, however.</li>
          <li><span class="cl-a">Added</span> The ability for the camera to be influenced by the group and the cursor. Added an option to control how much the cursor influences it.</li>

    <p><i>July 5th, 2022 &ndash; the "polish" update</i></p>

    <p><b>Gameplay changes</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Added a help page to the pause menu, with gameplay information, tips, controls, Pikmin type explanations, and more.</li>
      <li>White Pikmin poison now applies a status effect that drains health over time. Enemies still end up losing the same amount of health in the end.</li>
      <li>Pikmin are now better at detecting gates and other rectangular objects.</li>
      <li>Pikmin can now circle around enemies when in combat.</li>
      <li>Bridges now grow in chunks, and the point Pikmin deliver fragments to, or the position of the pile of sticks, now moves along with the bridge.</li>
      <li>
        Misc. graphical enhancements:
        <ul>
          <li>All gates have received graphical improvements.</li>
          <li>Decorative objects no longer cast light in blackout weather.</li>
          <li>When Pikmin deliver an object to an Onion, ship, etc., the sucking animation is now more dynamic. Also, added a tossing animation for delivering bridge fragments to bridges.</li>
          <li>Improved the look of the ship's beam and the leader's whistle. The <code>pretty_whistle</code> option has been removed. (Thanks Helodity)</li>
          <li>HUD elements now animate when things change, and slide off-frame when menus are entered in-game. (Thanks Helodity)</li>
          <li>In-game message boxes are now much more animated.</li>
          <li>Health wheels and fraction numbers now appear and disappear smoothly, and are more animated in general.</li>
          <li>Enemies now squash and stretch when damaged.</li>
          <li>Objects being carried now sway.</li>
          <li>Icons for controls have been improved.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed leaders being able to grab group members from the other side of walls or objects with collision, like gates.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Content making changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="mob_bridge.html">Bridges</a> are now made up of objects. This should make the process of placing bridges in an area much simpler, since there's no need to fiddle around with sectors. Areas with bridges need to be updated to use this new bridge format.</li>
      <li><a href="status.html">Status effects</a> now have a <code>health_change</code> property, which controls how much health the object loses per second in an absolute value, instead of it being a ratio of total health.</li>
      <li><a href="misc_config.html#spike-damage">Spike damage types</a> now have a <code>status_to_apply</code> property, which allows the damaged object to receive a status effect.</li>
      <li><a href="mob_type.html">Object types</a> now have a <code>status_vulnerabilities</code> block, which works like the other vulnerability blocks, but controls damage taken from status effects.</li>
      <li><a href="mob_type.html">Object types</a> now have a <code>terrain_radius</code> property, which controls their collision against walls.</li>
      <li><a href="mob_type.html">Object types</a> now have a <code>description</code> property, which can be used to briefly describe it. This 
        appears in the area editor, and Pikmin types make use of this for the help page of the in-game pause menu.</li>
      <li>The tooltip of an <a href="mob_type.html">object type</a>'s area editor property now word-wraps automatically. If you relied on line breaks (<code>\n</code>) to do this before, you may want to adjust it.</li>
      <li>The <code>set_animation</code> <a href="events_and_actions.html">script action</a> now accepts the options <code>random_time</code> and <code>random_time_on_spawn</code>, to let the animation start on a random time, or start on a random time but only if the mob just spawned.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>on_receive_delivery</code> <a href="events_and_actions.html">object script event</a>.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>health_ratio</code> option to the <code>get_info</code> <a href="events_and_actions.html">object script action</a>.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>health</code> <a href="script.html">script variable</a>.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>max_health</code> <a href="script.html">script variable</a>.</li>
      <li>Added the <code>bright_circle</code> and <code>bright_ring</code> <a href="misc_config.html">system assets</a>.</li>
      <li>The area editor now also shows the terrain radius of selected objects (if the "Show territory/terrain radius" option is on).</li>
      <li><a href="converter_type.html">Converters</a> now use an animation called <code>bumped</code> instead of <code>bumping</code>, for consistency's sake.</li>
      <li><a href="misc_config.html">System assets</a> no longer have icons for mouse-related controls, but instead have one spreadsheet for many special control icons.</li>
      <li>The <a href="gui.html">gameplay HUD</a> received all sorts of new items, and some have been renamed to be more consistent.</li>
      <li><a href="area.html">Areas</a> and <a href="animation.html">animations</a> now save the engine version they were edited in. This will likely be used in the future to allow the engine to automatically port older content to newer versions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="0.21.1">0.21.1</h2>
    
    <p><i>November 5th, 2021</i></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed Rock Pikmin not causing damage by charging. Custom Pikmin that attack via lunging need their <code>attacking</code> animation changed.</li>
      <li>Fixed a crash if Pikmin were thrown at an object and it disappeared during their <code>mob_landing</code> state. (Thanks Sharker, Kman)</li>
      <li>Fixed the manual's header not working under Chrome. (Thanks Kman)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="0.21.0">0.21.0</h2>
    
    <p><i>October 22nd, 2021 &ndash; the "Pikmin 3" update</i></p>
    
    <p><b>Gameplay changes</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Added Rock Pikmin.
        <ul>
          <li>When thrown at an enemy, they cause damage when they collide, and then bounce back.</li>
          <li>They also lunge forward on their own when they get close to an enemy they are chasing on foot. This impact works just like a throw, bounce back included.</li>
          <li>Also, updated the pellets, Pellet Posies, Candypop Buds, and Onions to support Rock Pikmin.</li>
          <li>Plus, added cystal walls, crystal nodules, large crystals, small crystals, and Skutterchucks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Added Winged Pikmin.
        <ul>
          <li>If their target is above or below them, they can move up and down in the air to get to it.</li>
          <li>When following a leader, they try to stay a bit above the leader, and when idling, they also try to idle some distance above-ground.</li>
          <li>Because they are flying in the air when following a leader, they can travel over bodies of water. That said, leaders that are underwater can't grab or throw them.</li>
          <li>Also, updated the pellets, Pellet Posies, Candypop Buds, and Onions to support Winged Pikmin.</li>
          <li>Plus, added bamboo gates, Flukeweeds, and Puffy Blowhogs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added Bulbmin, both adults and young. They are invulnerable to all elemental hazards, but the young lack an Onion or ship to go to.</li>
      <li>Added Alph, Brittany, and Charlie, as well as the S.S. Drake. The Hocotatian leaders also got a glow-up. The President's color was changed to yellow, otherwise half of the leaders would be blue.</li>
      <li>Purple Pikmin now cause a bit of collision damage when they land on an enemy after being thrown.</li>
      <li>Enemies petrified with the ultra-bitter spray now shake before breaking free, their petrification visually bursts when it's over, and their animations now properly freeze.</li>
      <li>Munge Dweevils can now pick up treasure.</li>
      <li>Pikmin will now only take paths that they can survive. e.g. a carcass with 1 Red Pikmin and 9 Blue Pikmin carrying it will take a path that doesn't go through water, but a carcass carried by 10 Blue Pikmin might take that water path.</li>
      <li>Objects now move with acceleration. This should make them a bit smoother when moving.</li>
      <li>
        Revamped the cursor.
        <ul>
          <li>The leader cursor's color now matches the standby Pikmin's color. If there is none, it uses a faded cyan color.</li>
          <li>The number of Pikmin of the standby type now also appears next to the cursor.</li>
          <li>There is now a line connecting the leader to the cursor. When the leader has a group member, the line changes to represent a preview of how that member would be thrown. This helps to show which ledges can and can't be reached.</li>
          <li>Added an option to set the cursor's speed, used when controlling it without a mouse. (Thanks MonkeyUhOh)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If a Pikmin is lying down, a leader can now whistle it to make it get up faster, and return to the leader once it does.</li>
      <li>Added an option to allow the leader to auto-throw. If you prefer not to mash the throw button, consider turning this on.</li>
      <li>If a new leader shows up from a defeated enemy, their HUD information will now display properly. (Thanks pikminjosh)</li>
      <li>All menus now have a tooltip for the currently selected item.</li>
      <li>The in-game message box now looks like other boxes, instead of a stretched flat image.</li>
      <li>Fullscreen mode now uses a simple borderless window. True fullscreen mode can still be enabled in the <a href="options.html">options</a> file, but comes with risks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Content making changes</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rock Pikmin-related features:
        <ul>
          <li>Added a property for <a href="mob_pikmin.html">Pikmin types</a>, <code>attack_method</code>, that controls how the Pikmin attacks. If set to <code>impact</code>, that Pikmin attacks like a Rock Pikmin, as explained above.</li>
          <li>Their on-foot lunges use the attack animation, so it should ideally be in a pose where they lunge forward, and have a hitbox.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Winged Pikmin-related features:
        <ul>
          <li>Added a property for <a href="mob_pikmin.html">Pikmin types</a>, <code>can_fly</code>, that makes a Pikmin fly like a Winged Pikmin, as explained above.</li>
          <li>These Pikmin can only move vertically if the state they are in allows it (e.g. they can't fly if they're being knocked back).</li>
          <li>Technically, if a leader is on a floor with a hazard (liquid or otherwise), they will be unable to grab Pikmin that are outside it and are vulnerable to the hazard. If they grab and bring those Pikmin to said floor, the Pikmin will suffer the effects.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Pikmin now have a new state that is entered when they land on a mob, <code>mob_landing</code>. In it, they change to an animation of the same name. It is only after this animation ends that they latch on or bounce back. As such, this animation is a good opportunity to get the Pikmin to cause damage upon collision.</li>
      <li>
        Revamped paths.
        <ul>
          <li>If a path stop is on top of a sector with hazards, objects will now be unable to traverse it if they are vulnerable to the hazards. In the case of a carried object, this applies to the carrier Pikmin. If there is another path, they will take it, otherwise they will stay stuck in front of that path stop. If the hazard is only on the floor, and the object or carrier Pikmin can fly, then they will still take that path.</li>
          <li>Path links now have a type. "Normal" works like normal, "custom only" can only be used by objects that need that path for scripting, "light load only" can only be taken by objects carrying a weight of 1 or nothing, and "airborne only" can only be taken by flying objects.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Revamped the <a href="status.html">status</a> system.
        <ul>
          <li>Added the <code>animation_change</code> property, which lets the object's animation be changed when the status is applied.</li>
          <li>Added the <code>freezes_animation</code> property. If true, the object will stay stuck in its current sprite until the status effect is removed.</li>
          <li>Added the <code>reapply_rule</code> property, which controls what happens to the auto-remove time of a status effect in case it is re-applied.</li>
          <li>Added the <code>remove_on_hazard_leave</code> property. This is now used for statuses like drowning, where the status effect is removed once the object leaves the hazard that was applying the status effect.</li>
          <li>Added the <code>replacement_on_timeout</code> property, which lets a status effect be swapped for another when its time runs out.</li>
          <li>Added the <code>state_change_type</code> and <code>state_change_name</code> properties, so status effects can change the object's state when applied.</li>
          <li>Added the <code>shaking_effect</code> property, which makes the object shake left and right while under the effects of the status effect.</li>
          <li>Object types, in their hazard vulnerability data and spike damage vulnerability data, can now be told to receive a status effect when interacting with one.</li>
          <li>Plus other changes noted below in the compatibility warnings.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        New <a href="script.html">mob script</a> actions:
        <ul>
          <li><code>load_focused_mob_memory</code> and <code>save_focused_mob_memory</code> let the currently focused object be saved into a memory, and be recalled later. This allows the object to keep track of more than one object at a time, although it still only focuses on one at a time.</li>
          <li><code>link_with_focused_mob</code> lets the object be linked to whatever object it has in focus.</li>
          <li><code>hold_focused_mob</code> lets the object hold whatever object it has in focus, much like how a leader holds a Pikmin.</li>
          <li><code>throw_focused_mob</code> lets the focused object be thrown in an arc towards a destination.</li>
          <li><code>store_focus_inside</code> lets the object store another one inside, to be released later.</li>
          <li><code>release_stored_mobs</code> lets the object release any other object that is stored inside.</li>
          <li><code>get_angle</code> lets the script obtain the angle between two sets of coordinates.</li>
          <li><code>get_coordinates_from_angle</code> lets the script obtain the X and Y coordinates calculated from a given angle and distance.</li>
          <li><code>get_distance</code> lets the script obtain the distance between two sets of coordinates.</li>
          <li><code>get_floor_z</code> lets the script obtain the Z coordinate of the floor at the specified coordinates.</li>
          <li><code>set_can_block_paths</code> lets the object block or stop blocking the paths of others.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Other <a href="script.html">mob script</a> changes:
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>move_to_absolute</code> and <code>move_to_relative</code> actions can now use an optional Z coordinate argument.</li>
          <li>The <code>turn_to_absolute</code> and <code>turn_to_relative</code> actions can now either use an angle argument, or coordinate arguments.</li>
          <li>Added <code>group_task_power</code> and <code>angle</code> to the <code>get_info</code> action, so a group task object can obtain the current "Pikmin power" applied to it, and so an object can obtain its current angle, respectively.</li>
          <li>The <code>on_hitbox_touch_a_n</code> event used to trigger regardless of the first hitbox's type. This has now been fixed, and <code>on_hitbox_touch_n_n</code> was created for when the both hitboxes are of the normal type.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="mob_group_task.html">Group task object type</a> improvements:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Animation changes. These are needed in order for <a href="mob_pikmin.html">Pikmin</a> to get up when whistled, and for Purple Pikmin and Rock Pikmin to cause collision damage:
        <ul>
          <li><code>lying</code> is now just the Pikmin lying down forever.</li>
          <li><code>knocked_back</code> is a new animation for the Pikmin getting knocked back forever.</li>
          <li><code>getting_up</code> is a new animation for the Pikmin getting up from lying down.</li>
          <li><code>mob_landing</code> is a new animation for the thrown Pikmin landing on a mob and getting ready, and/or causing damage.</li>

        <a href="status.html">Status effect</a> changes:
        <ul>
          <li>Turned the <code>disabled_state_inedible</code> status effect type property to <code>turns_inedible</code> instead. This way, any status can make a Pikmin inedible while under its effects.</li>
          <li>The <code>causes_*</code> status effect type properties were removed in favor of the <code>state_change_type</code> property. Anything related to the Pikmin's "disabled" state has now also been renamed to the more apt term "helpless".</li>
          <li>The <code>on_hitbox_touch_a_n</code> event was corrected, so if you relied on the incorrect behavior, use <code>on_hitbox_touch_n_n</code> instead.</li>
          <li>The <code>animation</code> and <code>animation_mob_scale</code> properties have been renamed to <code>overlay_animation</code> and <code>overlay_anim_mob_scale</code>, respectively.</li>
        </ul>

    <p><i>April 24th, 2021 &ndash; the "missing menus" update</i></p>
    
    <p><b>Changes</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Revamped Onions.
        <ul>
          <li>Interacting with an Onion now displays a menu to manage the Pikmin with.</li>
          <li>Pikmin now have logic to climb up an Onion's legs and enter, or to come out and slide down a leg.</li>
          <li>An Onion can now manage multiple Pikmin types, not just one.</li>
          <li>Ships can now store and manage Pikmin, just like Onions.</li>
          <li>The pre-packaged Onion graphics now animate, and look like the more modern Onion designs.</li>
          <li>Added a new Onion type that manages all three &ndash; the Master Onion.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Added a results screen.
        <ul>
          <li>When the player finishes playing in an area, the results screen gives them some basic stats: time taken, treasure points obtained, treasure points available, enemies killed, enemies available, Pikmin born, and Pikmin deaths.</li>
          <li>The player is also given the option to retry, keep playing after hours, or pick a different area.</li>
          <li>The results screen is entered when the player chooses to end the day via the pause menu, when the day time is over, or when all leaders are KO.
          <li>Added a new property for treasure types: <code>points</code>. Use this to specify how many points they are worth.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added a pause menu. Players can retry, end the day, or quit to the area selection menu from here.</li>
      <li>
        Revamped GUI.
        <ul>
          <li>Updated all menus to have a better and more unified look.</li>
          <li>The position of GUI items in all menus can now be customized, just like the HUD was customizable until now.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Revamped edge aesthetics.
        <ul>
          <li>You can go to the area editor, select edges, and edit their properties.</li>
          <li>With this, you can control how and if walls cast a shadow, as well as their color and length. (Thanks Scruffy, Neo)</li>
          <li>You can also now make the higher sector of a wall look smooth at the ledge, instead of the ledge abruptly cutting off to the lower sector. (Thanks Tenacious)</li>
          <li>Finally, bodies of water will now have a simple foam effect around their limits.</li>
          <li>Wall shadows have been revamped to work better in general.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Expanded the <code>get_info</code> action:
        <ul>
          <li>Added new data: <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. Use these to get the object's coordinates. (Thanks Kman)</li>
          <li>Also added <code>focus_distance</code>. Use this to get the distance between this object and its focused object.</li>
          <li>Added a new action: <code>get_focus_info</code>. It works like <code>get_info</code>, but when applicable, gets info from the focused mob instead. (Thanks Kman)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added a mob script event, <code>on_leave_hazard</code>, and added a way to get the name of the hazard via the <code>get_info</code> action, both for this event and <code>on_touch_hazard</code>. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>Pikmin now push each other slightly.</li>
      <li>Health wheels now transition smoothly to their target value, and also fade away when they are empty. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>Added new system assets: <code>bubble_box</code>, used to draw box-like bubbles in the HUD and menus, <code>focus_box</code>, used to show which GUI item is focused, and <code>more</code>, used for menus to indicate there's more content beyond.</li>
      <li>Holding Shift when the snapping mode is "nothing" will now snap to the grid in the area editor. The snapping mode is now also saved to the options. Finally, Shift+Plus and Shift+Minus change the grid spacing. (Thanks Nutty171, Neo)</li>
      <li>Players can now customize the colors of the GUI widgets in the editors. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>The Beady Long Legs's logic was slightly cleaned up.</li>
      <li>Revamped code and added instructions to make it possible to compile on Mac OS. (Thanks MidnightWhisper)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><b>Compatibility warnings</b></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Onion types now use the <code>pikmin_types</code> property instead of <code>pikmin_type</code>.</li>
      <li>The mouse cursor graphic now displays at full-size, all the time. If you made a custom one, you'll probably want to resize its image file to 70% its old size.</li>
      <li>The pre-packaged Pellet Posy graphics files are now split per-type, as opposed to per-size. This makes more sense for adding new types of Pikmin/pellet. (Thanks Kman)</li>
      <li>The counter font now also includes a dot and a colon. If you changed this font, please update it accordingly.</li>
      <li>The gameplay HUD information is now stored in <code>Game_data/GUI/Gameplay.txt</code>, and the title screen logo information now goes in <code>Game_data/GUI/Main_menu.txt</code>.</li>
      <li>The sector property "always casts shadow" has been removed, and wall shadows should be slightly less dark than before in general. If you have walls that you need to look the same as before, you'll want to go to the edge properties and tweak their shadow's length and color.</li>
    </ul>
