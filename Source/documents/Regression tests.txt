This document lists a series of tests you should do after changing the logic for sectors, or physics, or what have you.
Testing all of these scenarios helps make sure that the changes didn't break anything.

Sector drawing test cases.
In the diagrams, at symbols are a sector being drawn.
When testing, test with the specified sectors in the void, and inside a big sector.

* Draw a rectangle where one edge is inside a sector, the next shares surface with an edge of that same sector, the next goes from one vertex to another of the sector, but cross the parent sector, and then the next closes off.
* The engine shouldn't let you work on different sectors.

* With just a leader:
1. Move
2. Slide against walls
3. Walk on edges
4. Walk off an edge and try to move in mid-air
5. Go up and down a rising bridge
6. Go up and down a rising bridge while also rubbing against the rail
7. Walk against all the test walls in the Tests area
8. Try to wedge yourself between a pushing mob and a wall
9. Fall on top of a walkable mob
10. Go on top of a walkable mob that's flush to a wall and hug the walls
11. Go on top of a walkable mob from a staircase sector
12. Be bounced by a bouncer
13. Be pushed by several mobs at once

* Get some Pikmin and:
1. Hold a Pikmin and move around
2. Throw a Pikmin against a wall, but to an edge it can reach, at a slide angle
3. Throw a Pikmin against a wall, but to an edge it can reach, straight-on
4. Throw a Pikmin at an edge without touching a wall
5. Throw a Pikmin to an edge that's just barely in its reach
6. Have Pikmin carry something
7. Have Pikmin latch on to something
8. Have Pikmin drag something that can be pushed, like a cardboard box
9. Move whilst on top of a moving walkable mob
10. Move whilst on top of a mob that is changing its height
