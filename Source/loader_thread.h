/*
 * This thread makes it easy to create threads that load content.
 * Just give it a function that loads data, and you're ready to go.
 * The loading function should take a pointer to the Allegro thread (unused)
 * as well as a pointer to its loader_thread object, used to update the
 * loading percentage. The loader thread should update the percentage as
 * smoothly as it decides. Meanwhile, the main thread is in charge of
 * waiting for it, and drawing a number on-screen, or something.
